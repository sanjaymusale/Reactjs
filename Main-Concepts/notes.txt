props in class compomnent is made available via this.props  

to update the state we must use amethod  called as setState
setState method takes a function as argument
for that function previous state value will be passed as an argument
the set state method should return the updated state value set
after the state is updated via the setState method,

controlled components - the input fields value must be kept in state



//When the state is maintained in the parent, and the change of values to the state will be from the child (ex like delete, or submit , events), the child cannot directly update the state value, because of uni directional data flow of react,for updating the state value we have a method defined in the parent and passed down as a prop to the child. when an event occurs, the method which is passed as a prop to the child will be invoked in the child component
